This repository contains coursework, projects, and academic materials completed during my studies in **Computer Science (КН)** at the **Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics (ФМИ), Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski" (СУ)**.

The program is known for its strong theoretical and technical foundation and is among the most competitive tracks at the university. The specialty is highly selective and academically demanding, covering a wide range of advanced CS and mathematics subjects.

## Notable Projects

This repository also references several standalone university projects that represent some of my more advanced and complete work. These are included as Git submodules:

- **JMT** – A full Java project following the “Java Methods and Technologies” university program (JMT2023) taught by Stoyan Velev. The program is very in-depth and follows modern Java design principles, covering contemporary technologies and best practices in the Java ecosystem.
- **AudioToTextClassifier** – A complete end-to-end project for speech-to-text transcription and intent classification.  
  Includes audio processing with Whisper, text preprocessing, model training, dataset integration, a Flask inference server, and evaluation.  
  Implements classification into tasks, reminders, notes, and events using multiple merged NLP datasets.
- **UniPython24** – Coursework from the university Python module, including notebooks and assignments focusing on algorithms, data processing, and Python software development.

These projects are maintained in their own repositories and integrated here for completeness and easy access.
